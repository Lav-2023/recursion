Recursion
This 'Recursion' project is part of 'The Odin project'.

Running your project code:
As there is no GUI component to this project, it should be run in the command line rather than the browser.

JavaScript files can be run directly from the command line using the node command installed with nodejs.

In this assignment,

First up create a file and tackle the fibonacci sequence:

1. Using iteration, write a function <code style="color : `rgb(9, 105, 218)`">fibs</code> which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.  
   Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

2. Now write another function <code style="color:red">fibsRec</code> which solves the same problem recursively.  

3. Test both versions of your functions by passing in various lengths as arguments.        


Once you have a firm grasp on solving Fibonacci with recursion, create a new file and work on a merge sort:  

1. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.  
   An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13],/ and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].  

Tips:

Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again/ and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same function!).  

Test it out

To showcase the recursive effect implemented in your Fibonacci function, do the following:

1. Add the following to the start of the function:

   console.log("This was printed recursively");

2. Call the function with 8 as the argument.

3. If the function is implemented correctly, you should see that sentence printed around 8 times  
   (keep in mind that, depending on the way you implemented the function, you may see 7 instead of 8.  
   This isnâ€™t a bug! It simply depends on how many times the function is actually repeated).
